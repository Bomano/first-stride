        <h2>Pilau</h2>
        <p>Pelau is delicious on its own and can be served as a stand-alone meal, however, if you want a full Kenyan experience simply pair with Kachumbari – a cool and refreshing salad made with tomatoes, red onions, cilantro and a spicy pepper like serrano chili pepper.

          <h2>How to make The East African Rice Pilau</h2>
          <li>Toast and blend the pilau masala: In a medium saucepan over medium heat. </li>
         <li>Brown the onions by frying it in oil until it caramelizes. This should take about 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in the Garlic, ginger and serrano pepper.</li>
          <li>Add the meat stock cubes, pilau masala, cilantro, bay leaves, and salt to taste and brown the meat for about 
          Stir in the tomatoes and cook till it dissolves. Then stir in the potatoes.</li>
          <li>Add water and bring everything to a rolling boil and leave the potatoes to cook for about 10 minutes.</li>
          <li>Stir in the rice then cover tightly. You can use an aluminum foil to cover it first, this will help keep the steam in. Then place the lid over it and leave to cook on a low heat for 20 minutes until the liquid has been absorbed.</li>
           <li>Serve hot! You can sprinkle the rice pilaf with some chopped cilantro, then fluff with a fork. Enjoy.</li>

        <h2>Mukimo-peas</h2>
        <p>Mukimo is a Kenyan dish consisting of potatoes, and mashed green vegetables (and corn). I tasted the dish for the first time when we were in Kenya last spring, and have now made my own version. In some recipes, they also use pumpkin leaves, which create a more powerful green color.</p>
        <img src="mukimo.jpeg" alt="mukimo">
        <p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>500 grams of potatoes</li>

<li>150 grams of frozen peas
</li>
<li>140 grams (1 can) of corn</li>

<li>Salt and pepper</li>

<li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
</ul>
<p>
  <h3>Instructions</h3>
Peel and boil the potatoes in water, until tender.
When there are about 5 minutes left of the cooking time, boil the peas in lightly salted water. Also boil the corn in a separate saucepan in lightly salted water. Let the peas boil for a few minutes before pouring off most of the cooking water (leave some left). Run the peas together with a hand blender until you have a coarse puree.
When the potatoes have finished cooking, mash them using a potato masher or similar.
Mix mashed potatoes, pea puree and corn (pour off the water first) together in a saucepan. Add a knob of butter and season with salt and pepper.
Serve the mukimo with meat or fish.

        <h2>Githeri</h2>
        <p>Githeri is made from corn and beans, which are cooked until ready by the use of a stove or gas. It can also be cooked using a wooden cooker, for economic purposes. It takes a while, depending on the type of maize that has been used. If the variety of maize used is soft, the cooking time is relatively shorter as opposed to using the hard ones.</p>

        <h2>Matoke</h2>
        <p>Matoke is a simple, healthy, and delicious one-pot East African dish made from green bananas. Easy to prepare but can fill you up for hours! Great for lunch or dinner.
          Matoke can be made in different ways, but I like to make mine with meat (beef or lamb) with a thick, rich sauce. It's simple and hearty!
        </p>
        <img src="Matoke.jpeg" alt="Matoke">
        <h3>Ingredients for making matoke</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Matoke - Don't worry, the only ingredient that can take you to the Asian store is the matoke. Every other ingredient in this recipe is either in your pantry or your local grocery store.</li>
          <li>Oil -Any good cooking oil will work</li>
          <li>Medium onion - diced</li>
          <li>Lamb or beef - cut into small cubes.</li>
          <li>Seasoning and spices - paprika, cayenne pepper, garlic, ginger, curry powder, chicken bouillon powder, salt, and pepper</li>
          <li>Tomatoes - diced</li>
          <li>Water or chicken stock - I used chicken stock for a deeper flavor profile.</li>
          <li>Herbs- A handful of chopped coriander leaves or cilantro</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          <h3>Instructions</h3>
          Peel and cut the matoke into 1.5 - 2 inch pieces. Put them in water till you are ready to use them so that they don't become discolored.
          Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat, add onions, and cook until soft, about 2 minutes.
          Stir in the garlic and ginger and cook until fragrant—a few seconds.
          Stir in the beef and add the paprika, curry powder, bouillon powder, salt, and pepper. Mix well, cover, and leave to cook for 10 minutes, stirring halfway between.
          Add the matoke, diced tomatoes, and stock (or water), stir, cover, and leave to simmer for 25 to 30 minutes or till the matoke becomes tender.
          Stir in the coriander and serve.</p>

        <h2>Ugali-beef</h2>
        <p>A classic Kenyan beef stew accompanied with properly cooked Ugali is everyone’s favourite. My method is one that results in beautifully cooked tender meat, however, you may some times purchase meat that is hard and needs to be boiled before adding to the pot.</p>
        <img src="ugali-beef.png" alt="">
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <h4>For the beef stew:</h4><br>
        2 tbsp oil
        1 onion, chopped
        1 tbsp garlic, minced
        1 tsp curry powder
        500 gms beef cubes
        1 beef stock cube
        Salt to taste
        Freshly ground black pepper
        3 tomatoes, diced
        4 cups water
        Coriander leaves, chopped
        <h4>For Ugali:</h4><br>
        3 cups water
        1 1/2 cups Unga wa Dola maize meal
          <h3>Instructions</h3>
          <h4>For the beef stew:</h4>
           Heat oil in a heavy based pot. Add the onions and stir. Cook for 30 seconds or until translucent.
-Stir in the garlic and curry powder. Add the beef cubes, stock cube, salt, pepper, tomatoes and water and stir.
-Cover the pot with a lid and let simmer for 30-40 minutes. Garnish with coriander leaves and set aside while you prepare the ugali.
<h4>For Ugali:</h4> Bring the water to boil in a pot/sufuria. Add 1/2 cup maize meal to the boiling water. Adding a little bit of the meal to the water ensures that the water starts to roar which makes the perfect ugali. Stir using a wooden spatula and try to break any lumps apart.
-Add the remaining flour and get stirring. Using the spatula, smoothen out any lumps that may have formed. If the ugali is not hard enough, add more flour. Lower the heat and keep working the ugali against the sides of the pot, getting rid of any lumps and also making sure it is evenly cooked.
-Once cooked, mould it using the spatula and serve with a serving of beef stew.

        <h2>Indian chapat</h2>
        <p>Chapati is a traditional unleavened Indian flatbread made with just 3 ingredients - whole wheat flour, ghee/oil & water. Optionally a little salt is added.
        </p>
        <p>The term Chapati has been derived from the Hindi word “Chapat” meaning “slap” or “flat” which describes the traditional method of shaping chapati by slapping the dough in between the palms.Later rolling pin has over taken this method of slapping the dough.</p>
        <img src="indian chapati.png" alt="indian chapati">
         <h3>Ingredients</h3>
         <ol>
          <li>185g (1 Cup) Chapati or Atta Flour</li>
          <li>100-120ml (⅓ Cup + 1 Tbsp to ½ Cup) Water</li>
          <li>¼ Tsp Salt</li>
          <li> ½ Tbsp Cooking Oil</li>
          <li>Ghee for brushing (Optional)</li>
         </ol>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>-Place the atta flour, water, salt and oil in a bowl and bring the ingredients together with a fork, then go in with your hands and need to form a ball. Do not overwork just form a nice dough ball, the dough should not stick to your hands but only just, add more flour or water if required.</li>
          <li>-Cover the dough and allow it to rest for at least 30 minutes and up to 4 hours.</li>
          <li>-Pinch off ⅙ of the dough and form a ball and dip it into some atta flour.</li>
          <li> -Roll out into an even circle 1-2mm thick adding more flour if you need to. I find a marble board really helps with this. Repeat with the remaining dough keeping the chapatis separate with some baking parchment.</li>
          <li>-Heat a tawa or crepe pan over a medium high heat and add a chapati, cook until the top begins to bubble, flip the chapati, cook for 1 minute and flip again. If you have rolled your chapatis evenly they should puff up.</li>
          <li>-Repeat with the remaining chapatis, wrap them in a clean tea towel to keep them warm and soft.</li>

        <h2>Dao xiao mian noodles</h2>
        <img src="kc-noodles.jpeg" alt="">
        <p>Knife cut noodles (刀削面 dao xiao mian) are legendary in China, a specialty of the Shanxi province. They are known as knife-shaved, knife-cut, pared noodles, or even peel noodles. In Chinese, they’re刀削面 (dao xiao mian.) The method of making them is an art form that takes years of practice.</p>

        <img src="knife-cut noodles.jpeg
        " alt="">
        <img src="ingredientsfor noodles.jpeg" alt="">
        <p>The true, authentic technique is to hold a large block of dough with one hand at about a 30 degree angle downwards. With the other hand clutching a special sharp knife specifically made for this purpose, the noodles are shaved directly into a large pot of boiling water. It’s fast and has been described as an endless loop. If you youtube “knife cut noodles”, there are videos showing super chefs shaving off pieces of noodle so fast that you can’t see the individual ones – it’s a big blur, like they’re kung-fu masters or something. I’m not even going to claim to have that technique mastered. If you’re going to make these noodles frequently, then I would recommend buying one of these special knifes – it’s almost like a sheet of metal, slightly curved –to aid in the process. Otherwise, I’ve provided an alternative method to cutting the noodles. It won’t produce the signature thicker-in-middle and thinner-on-sides shape of the noodles, but it will give you thick, chewy knife-cut noodles with all of its rustic, imperfect charm. I highly recommend this alternative method, especially since the slower you shave your noodles, the more unevenly they will be cooked.</p>
        <p>The dough is tricky – it needs a high-protein flour (I used bread flour), a tiny bit of water compared to the amount of flour needed, and time to rest after kneading. I remember one of my favorite quotes from Jodi Picoult’s book, The Storyteller: “It’s silly to anthropomorphize bread, but I love the fact that it needs to sit quietly, to retreat from touch and noise and drama, in order to evolve.” The same can be applied to noodle dough. It’s imperative for the dough to rest after each knead. The dough will not be soft and elastic. It’ll be smooth but hard, and honestly a pain to knead. Think of it as an arm workout! I don’t know if I’ll ever master the true technique of shaving noodles, but the texture and taste of these noodles are good enough to satisfy my cravings for dao xiao mian. I’ve already made these three times and I don’t think that’s going to be the end of it!</p>
        <h3>knife-cut-noodles:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>4 cups bread flour, plus more as needed</li>
          <li>1 cup plus 2 tablespoons cold water, divided</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>steps to make knife-cut-noodles</h3>
        <u>
          <li>First, make a well in flour in a large bowl. Add water in increments, mixing with chopsticks until all water has been added. It will look shaggy</li>
          <li>Using hands to mix, knead to form a rough dough inside the bowl. If it’s too dry, add more water, 1 tbsp at a time. The dough should be dry. Knead until there are no residue clumps of dough in the bowl or on your hands. Once it resembles a rough dough, turn it onto a dry surface and knead for 5-6 minutes. Surface should start to become smooth.</li>
          <li>Wrap in plastic wrap and rest for 15 minutes. This allows the flour to hydrate. Remove dough from plastic wrap and knead on dry surface for another 5-6 minutes. Wrap in plastic and rest for another 15 minutes.

          </li>
          <li>Remove from plastic wrap and knead for another 5-6 minutes. Knead into a long oval shape. Fold dough in thirds. Knead into a long oval shape again, and repeat this process another two times. Form into a long oval shape and wrap in plastic. Rest in the fridge for 30 minutes. At this point, dough’s surface should be “guan hua ti shi” –very smooth</li>
          <li>After 30 minutes, you can begin to cut the dough into noodles. If you want to try out the real way, use a very sharp knife and have a pot of boiling water ready. With your left hand, hold oval dough, pointed downward at a 30 degree angle. You can place the dough on a flat surface, like a small cutting board, to make very smooth, even cuts. With your right hand, begin to shave your knife down the dough. There’s a saying that will help you visualize this technique: 刀不离面，面不离刀”” , which means knife doesn’t leave the dough, and dough doesnt leave the knife. It should be a continuous loop. This technique is tricky without the right tools. I opted to do the second technique</li>
          <li>Place oval onto a flat surface. Use your knife and start slicing off noodle pieces, as if it were a vegetable. You can control the thickness and length. Be sure to generously flour pieces of noodle to prevent sticking.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>If you’re using the noodles for a stir-fry, remove the noodles as soon as the water returns to a boil. Rinse them with cold water and set aside. If you are using these noodles for a soup, cook them completely through, about 8 minutes. Either way, you should use the noodles immediately to ensure freshness, but if you must store them, dust the raw noodles with flour to prevent sticking, and store them in an airtight zipper bag in the refrigerator — they will last for a few days.

            My favorite way to use them is the way I’ve had them most as a child -in stir fry!</p>

        <h2>Italian pasta with meat balls</h2>
        <p>Spaghetti with meatballs, as we know it today, is actually more of an Italian-American creation rather than a traditional Italian dish. The combination of spaghetti and meatballs became popular in the United States in the early 20th century, particularly among Italian immigrants.</p>

        <h2>Jolof rice with chicken</h2>
        <p>Jollof rice is a staple in West African cuisine. It’s made from rice, tomatoes, onions, peppers, and other seasonings. The dish is cooked in one pot. It’s simple and easy to make at home—and the end result is absolutely delicious!</p>
        <p>How To Cook Jollof Rice
          When cooking Jellof rice, building a flavor base is very important. Don’t be in haste to dump your ingredients in the pot otherwise, you will end up with what we call a ”concoction.” Each step counts, so try to do each of the steps in detail.
        </p>
        <p>The inevitable foundation for building up the flavor in this meal is to start by sauteeing the Onions. This should take about 3 to 5 minutes. The next thing is to stir in the tomato paste. This adds a deep and rich tomato flavor; I simply fry this for another 5 minutes or thereabout.
          <img src="JOLLOF RICE WITH CHICKEN.png" alt="JOLLOF RICE WITH CHICKEN">
          <h3>Ingredients</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>The main ingredient is rice(long-grain parboiled rice/basmati) for this recipe </li>
            <li>canned tomato, fresh tomatoes, bell peppers, scotch bonnet, onions, garlic, and ginger—each of which adds a unique flavor and texture to your dish!</li>
            <li>Oil for frying your sauce—any kind of vegetable oil will do.</li>
            <li>Stock—Chicken, beef, or vegetable stock are great choices here for adding depth of flavor.</li>
            <li>The seasoning and herbs—curry powder, salt, black/white pepper, bouillon powder, thyme, and bay leaves.</li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Cooking Instructions</h3>
          <ul>
          <li>Add the ginger and garlic and cook along with the tomato paste for another two minutes; Actually, by the time this is ready, you will notice it in the smell. If you keep it cooking any longer, you might risk burning them.
          </li>
          <li>Add the blended peppers. Usually, there is no particular time frame for frying this pepper. I often stop when the sauce becomes really thick, and the oil literally floats on top of the sauce. At this point, most of the water is gone, and the sauce no longer smells raw. Trust me, you will know, but just in case you are still in doubt, I would say maybe 15 to 20 minutes depending on the quantity of water in your blended pepper.</li>
          <li>Finally, in building my flavor, I add the thyme, curry powder, salt, white pepper (good but optional), and seasoning cubes. Adjust the seasoning at this point if there is a need to.
            Once the flavor is on point, then, I stir in the Rice. Make sure you stir the rice properly until you cover each grain of rice with the sauce.</li>
          <li>Now add the chicken stock. Give it a brief stir and cover it up with a tight-fitting lid. If your lid is not fitting enough, simply cover the rice with foil paper before covering it with the lid. This is because Jollof needs a lot of steam in order to turn out well.</li>
          <li>Once the rice comes to a boil, reduce the heat to medium-low immediately and continue to cook until the rice is done, about 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
          <li>Serve with Fried Chicken, Spicy Grilled Chicken, Grilled Tilapia Fish, or Gizzards and plantains.</li>
